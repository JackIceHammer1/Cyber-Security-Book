**18. Windows Defender Credential Guard

Windows Defender Credential Guard is a security feature designed to protect domain credentials by isolating them in a secure, virtualized environment. This helps prevent attackers from stealing credentials and using them for lateral movement within a network.

Virtualization-Based Security (VBS): Credential Guard leverages virtualization-based security to create an isolated container that protects credential information from being accessed by malicious software, even if the operating system is compromised.

LSA Isolated Mode: Credential Guard isolates the Local Security Authority (LSA) process, which stores credentials, in a secure environment. This prevents attackers from dumping credentials from the LSA process.

Credential Protection: Credential Guard protects various types of credentials, including NTLM password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and domain credentials. It significantly reduces the risk of credential theft and misuse.

Hardware Requirements: Credential Guard requires hardware features such as Secure Boot, TPM (Trusted Platform Module), and virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x or AMD-V).

**19. Windows Defender Device Guard

Windows Defender Device Guard is a set of security features designed to lock down devices and protect them from untrusted software and code execution. It ensures that only trusted applications and drivers can run on the system.

Code Integrity Policies: Device Guard enforces code integrity policies that define which code is allowed to run on the system. These policies are based on code signing and other attributes, ensuring that only trusted code can execute.

Code Signing: Device Guard relies on code signing certificates to verify the authenticity and integrity of software. Only code signed by trusted publishers is allowed to run.

Kernel Mode Code Integrity (KMCI): KMCI prevents unauthorized drivers and kernel-level code from running, protecting the operating system's core components from tampering.

Virtualization-Based Security (VBS): Like Credential Guard, Device Guard utilizes VBS to create a secure environment that isolates and protects critical system components from malware and unauthorized access.

Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI): HVCI ensures that only trusted kernel-mode code is executed. It uses the hypervisor to enforce code integrity policies, providing an additional layer of protection against kernel-level threats.
**20. Windows Defender Application Guard

Windows Defender Application Guard is a feature designed to protect systems from web-based threats by isolating untrusted websites in a secure container. It provides a safe browsing environment, preventing malicious websites from compromising the system.

Browser Isolation: Application Guard isolates browser sessions in a Hyper-V container, ensuring that any malicious activity on a website cannot affect the host operating system. This isolation prevents exploits, malware, and other threats from spreading.

Edge and Internet Explorer: Application Guard is available for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. When a user visits an untrusted website, the browser session is launched in an isolated container, providing a secure browsing experience.

Persistence and Data Sharing: By default, data created within the Application Guard container (such as cookies, cache, and downloads) is not shared with the host system. However, administrators can configure settings to allow limited data sharing if necessary.

Enterprise Integration: Application Guard can be managed and configured through Group Policy and Microsoft Intune, allowing organizations to enforce security policies and customize the browsing experience for their users.

**21. Windows Information Protection (WIP)

Windows Information Protection (WIP) is a data protection feature that helps safeguard sensitive business data from accidental leaks and unauthorized access. It provides a layer of protection by separating corporate and personal data on devices.

Data Classification: WIP allows administrators to classify data as corporate or personal. Corporate data is protected with encryption and access controls, while personal data remains accessible to the user.

Enterprise Data Protection (EDP): EDP ensures that corporate data is protected, even if it is moved to an untrusted application or location. It prevents data from being shared outside the organization or accessed by unauthorized users.

File Encryption: WIP uses file encryption to protect corporate data at rest and in transit. Encrypted files can only be accessed by authorized users and applications, ensuring data confidentiality.

App Protection: WIP can protect data within specific applications, ensuring that only authorized apps can access corporate data. This protection extends to cloud-based apps and services, providing a consistent approach to data security.

Policy Enforcement: Administrators can define WIP policies that control how data is accessed and shared. Policies can be configured to prevent data from being copied, shared, or printed without proper authorization.
**22. Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)

Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is a comprehensive security solution that provides advanced threat detection, investigation, and response capabilities. It helps organizations detect and respond to sophisticated cyber threats.

Threat Detection: ATP uses a combination of machine learning, behavioral analytics, and threat intelligence to detect advanced threats and attacks. It identifies suspicious activities, such as lateral movement, credential dumping, and fileless malware.

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): ATP includes EDR capabilities that provide detailed visibility into endpoint activities and behaviors. It helps security teams investigate incidents and respond to threats in real time.

Threat Intelligence: ATP leverages threat intelligence from Microsoft’s global security network to identify and block emerging threats. It provides context and insights into the latest attack techniques and tactics.

Automated Response: ATP includes automated response capabilities that help contain and remediate threats. It can automatically isolate compromised devices, block malicious processes, and remove malicious files.

Security Operations Center (SOC) Integration: ATP integrates with SOC tools and workflows, providing security teams with the information and tools they need to manage incidents and respond to threats effectively.
Summary

In this section of Chapter 4, we’ve explored additional advanced Windows security features, including Windows Defender Credential Guard, Device Guard, Application Guard, Windows Information Protection (WIP), and Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). These features provide robust protection against a wide range of cyber threats, from credential theft and unauthorized software execution to web-based attacks and data leaks. By implementing these advanced security measures, organizations can enhance their security posture and better protect their Windows environments against evolving cyber threats. The next chapter will delve into common Windows vulnerabilities and threats, providing insights into how attackers exploit these vulnerabilities and how to defend against them.
